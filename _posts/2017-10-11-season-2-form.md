This episode we get inside this thing we call storytelling and mess around with its form. &nbsp;Anita Flores and Brad Lawrence talk to us about how they like playing around and challenge this thing called "storytelling."&nbsp; We talk about long form, animation, interviews, pacing, and all kinds of tips and tricks and tactics that we use in performances.&nbsp; How can we keep challenging what stories are, how we tell them, and all of those things?&nbsp; Anita and Brad tell us their takes on all of this and much more!
