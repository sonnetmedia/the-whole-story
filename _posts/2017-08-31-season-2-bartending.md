This week, Julia and Asher go behind the bar. &nbsp;Or rather, talk to people who do. &nbsp;Amy and Sean are seasoned bartenders in NYC, which means they hear all kinds of stories, give out all kinds of advice, and meet all kinds of weird people. &nbsp;We talk about what a regular means, what starting off in bartending is like, and just how much people are willing to expose to people serving them booze. &nbsp;

Sean O'Brien is a comic/storyteller originally from Lavallette, New Jersey. &nbsp; He runs a monthly comedy show &nbsp;Titled Dummies&Company in Brooklyn NY. sean is a Moth Grandslam champion and can be seen at various comedy clubs all around the Tri-State Area.

Amy Whitehouse is a New York City native working in the restaurant industry for almost 10 years. &nbsp;
