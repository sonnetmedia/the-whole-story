Hi friends! &nbsp;Julia and Asher caught up to remind you about our upcoming LIVE SHOW on June 16th! &nbsp;

Shout outs in this episode to: The Lower East Side Film Festival, Susan Kent, David Crabb, Naked and Afraid, Jaime Brickhouse, and many others.

Please join us for our live show! &nbsp;

[RSVP HERE](http://civichall.org/events/the-whole-story-live-show/)

Join us as we celebrate the first season of the Whole Story! In our first 6 episodes we talked about what storytelling is, how it shapes who we are as people, performers, and professionals. We talked about the origins of the emerging storytelling scene, the roots of storytelling, and look at where it can go as a medium in the future.

For our first live show, we will have on our season 1 guests (Kevin Allison, Sandi Marx, Nisse Greenberg, Mark Pagan, and Dawn Fraser) and discuss these and more topics in more detail. Weâ€™ll also have special guest appearances of storytellers whom you may hear in season 2. The night will be hosted by Asher Novek and Julia Whitehouse, and presented by Nous Entertainment.
<br>
<br>$10 at the door. Refreshments will be served and lively conversation will transpire.
