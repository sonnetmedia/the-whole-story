This week we sat down with the ever-delightful Nisse Greenberg. &nbsp;We discuss the openness and raw emotions that storytelling can and should bring out in us, Nisse's own personal neuroses, and how a sketch about exploding diarrhea represented his true self. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Nisse Greenberg is an award winning storyteller and educator who has produced a bunch of shows and performed on more of them. He is the co-creator of VHS Presents and Drawn Out Storytelling, and the creator of Bad Feelings. He likes radishes. He once got paid to get naked and cry at lincoln center. He's sick right now. He thinks it's a sinus infection. He drank some horseradish and apple-cider vinegar, and now he's gonna make turmeric tea. (editor's note: Nisse is alive and healthy at present time) His playground is at nissegreenberg.com
