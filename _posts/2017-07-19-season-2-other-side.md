Have you ever told a story about someone and wondered, "I wonder what they thought about that?" Have you ever told a story about a significant other with them in the room?  Have they ever corrected you?  Julia and Asher got to talk to Matt and Elysha Dicks about storytelling and storylistening, what it's like on the other side of stories, and the importance of frozen corn.

Matthew Dicks is the internationally bestselling author of the novels Memoirs of an Imaginary Friend, Something Missing, Unexpectedly, Milo, The Perfect Comeback of Caroline Jacobs, and the upcoming The Other Mother.

Matthew is married to friend and fellow teacher, Elysha, and they have two children, Clara and Charlie. He grew up in the small town of Blackstone, Massachusetts, where he made a name for himself by dying twice before the age of eighteen and becoming the first student in his high school to be suspended for inciting riot upon himself.
