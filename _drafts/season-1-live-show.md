In our Season 1 live show we had Dawn Fraser, Sandi Marx, Mark Pagan, Nisse Greenberg, and Kevin Allison return for a panel discussion. &nbsp;With surprise guests Brad Lawrence and Colin Wilhm. &nbsp;We talked about &nbsp;where storytelling is going, who our Yodas are, and even played a game with our guests. &nbsp;

Thanks to everyone for making season 1 such a delight, we'll see you in the Fall for season 2!
