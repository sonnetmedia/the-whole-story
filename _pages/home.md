## The Whole Story is a podcast modeled after that panel discussion at storytelling festivals that you always miss.   

Asher and Julia talk with the most influential and inspirational storytellers and producers on the scene today.  They get to the nitty gritty of storytelling, discuss the words behind the words and dissect what makes a storyteller a storyteller.  

You’ve heard the stories, now get the whole story about who they are, what makes them tick, and where their stories come from.
